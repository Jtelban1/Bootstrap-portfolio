# Bootstrap-portfolio
- I used bootstrap in order to create the basic navbar and layouts for each webpage.
- I then created a container for each webpage in which I used row and columns to layout my information.
- I then created a style.css sheet for each html to help style each webpage.



- Portfolio has been updated with photos and links to project 1 and two assignments.
